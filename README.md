# create-bot-ts

This is a package that I use as some sort of starter template for Discord bots in typescript.

#### Its main features are

-   Yarn Berry
-   Git
-   Typescript
-   yarn version
-   yarn upgrade-interactive
-   husky
-   list-staged
-   eslit & prettier

After installation run:

```sh
yarn create @eslint/config
```
